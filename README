This is a Monte-Carlo Path Tracer written in Java. Be warned, I don't actually
think it compiles.

FEATURES:

Materials can have varying levels of the following:
    - reflection (RGB)
    - transmission (RGB)
    - absorbtion (RGB)

Paths bounce until one of the following happens:
    - a terminal object is encountered (e.g. some lamps, the sky)
    - the compile-time constant is reached

Mathematical algorithms all hand written by a high schooler and deemed horribly
inefficient by that same student two years later.

Thread class used for parallelization. After all, ray tracers are
"Embarrassingly parallel".

I think there might even be some hidden keybindings that bring up forgotten
features. If you see a "save as png" it may not actually save anything, idk.

Good luck with this piece of shit!
